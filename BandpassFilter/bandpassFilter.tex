\chapter{Bandpass Filter} \label{ch:bandpassFilter}

In this chapter, we introduce and analyze a bandpass filter for dispersive qubit measurement.
First, we explain the rationale for the bandpass filter and compare it qualitatively to existing systems.
Next, we quantitatively analyze the bandpass filter, arriving at a relation between the response time of the filtered measurement system and the coherence of the qubit.
The analysis is corroborated with numerics.
We then use the results of the analysis to choose circuit parameters.
We then determine the physical geometry of the hardware elements needed to achieve the desired circuit parameters.
Finally, we describe the fabrication steps used to build the device.
