Prior summary - How to measure the state of a qubit fast?
    Energy?
        No single photon detector
        "Always on" energy emission channel would lead to low T1
    Impedance
        Can use another frequency "dispersive"
            Probe impedance off resonance from qubit. Get state dependent phase shift
            Add linear mode to separate frequencies, "filter"
        Yale design
            Worked
            Awkward for multiple qubits
                One resonator -> one frequency for N qubits
                Have to distinguish 2**N posibilities in one IQ plane
        Our first design
            Frequency multiplexed
            Only distinguish 2 possibilities per IQ plane
            Minimal crosstalk by one resonator per channel
            Problems
                Leaking energy out the wrong port
                Can't beat Purcell limit
                    \kappa_r^2 T1 \propto eta.
                    For fixed T1 you can't change kappa
        Yale Purcell filter
            Fixed T1
            Still in unscalable system
            Appears to be very slow but not discussed in published work
            Other papers ignore this issue
                Siddiqi Dressed dephasing, Heralding had very low coherence
        Our filter
            One filter, but many measurement resonators
            Bandpass means all qubits are protected
            Design means very low on chip area. Important for larger system
