P.S. I found your thesis very helpful!  I think there is a minor typo on page 70- I think you want \delta y = \pm \chi/\omega_r (right now you have \delta y=\pm \chi, but later you write \delta y =\pm 1/2Q_l so the units don't match up).

Section 5.2 and 5.5 are repeats in the version I got from your group's website.
On page 181, I think there is a type on the first line (there is an omega - omega)...I think the first one is supposed to be capital omega.

The 'dielectric crossover' phrase confused me because that was the first use of that phrase.  You do state in your process summary that you cover that with aluminum.  I think maybe I just skimmed your process after reading the text and missed that and ended up confused.
