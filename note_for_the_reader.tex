The author's main objective in writing this thesis, aside from fulfilling the requirements of the Ph.D., was to produce a document which will be useful to other graduate students.
For this reason, there are included several pedagogical appendices covering the basic theory of superconducting qubits, relevant yet lesser known formulae in quantum theory, and several other similar topics.
If any of the discourse in these, or any other sections, could be clarified, please notify the author via the address below.
