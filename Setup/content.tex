\chapter{Experimental Setup and Methods} \label{ch:ExperimentalSetup}

In this chapter, we present the experimental apparatus used to test dispersive measurement with the bandpass filter.
In the first section, we show a complete schematic of the apparatus and describe how the measurement signal is brought into and out of the qubit chip.
In the next section, we discuss the details of generation of the measurement signals.
In the final section, we discuss details of detection of the measurement signals.
