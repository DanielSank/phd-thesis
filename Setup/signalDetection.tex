\section{Signal detection} \label{signalDetection}

The dispersed frequency components coming from the chip and subsequent amplifiers are, like the drive signal, of the form \begin{equation}
s(t) = \cos \left[ \left(\omega_c + \delta \omega \right) t + \phi \right] , \end{equation}
where $\omega_c$ is the frequency of the carrier, $\delta \omega$ is detuning of the measurement signal from the carrier, and $\phi$ is the phase of the signal which includes the phase shift caused by dispersion from the measurement resonator.
As shown in Appendix \ref{appendix:IQMixer}, after demodulation, the I and Q signals are \begin{equation}
I(t) = \cos\left(\delta\omega t + \phi \right) , \qquad Q(t) = \sin\left(\delta\omega t + \phi \right) . \end{equation}
These low frequency signals were digitized by the ADC to \begin{equation}
I_n = \cos\left(\delta\omega t_n + \phi \right) , \qquad Q_n = \sin\left(\delta\omega t_n + \phi \right) . \end{equation}
where $t_n = n / f_s $ and $f_s = 1/500\,\text{ns}$ is the sampling frequency of the ADC.\footnote{The sampling frequency is 1\,GHz, but time-adjacent samples are summed together in the FPGA to use less resources in the following processing stages.}
The sampled signals $I_n$ and $Q_n$ are treated as the real and imaginary parts of a complex number \begin{equation}
z_n \equiv I_n + iQ_n = \exp \left( i \left[ \delta \omega t_n + \phi \right] \right). \end{equation}
The complex signal $z_n$ is multiplied by $\exp \left(-i \delta \omega t_n \right)$ to produce \begin{equation}
z_n' \equiv z_n \exp \left( -i\delta\omega t_n \right) = \exp\left( i\phi \right) . \end{equation}
Finally, $z_n'$ is integrated over the duration of the pulse.
The integration acts as a low pass filter, which increases the signal to noise ratio.
The end result is a single point in the two-dimensional plane, whose phase is the same (up to constant rotations coming from digital and analog time delays) as the phase of the original analog signal.
In this way, the phase of the dispersed signal is measured and the corresponding qubit state inferred.
